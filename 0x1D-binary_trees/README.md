#### Learning project set for binary trees
**0-binary_tree_node.c**: Function that adds node to binary tree.  
**1-binary_tree_insert_left.c**: Function that adds a node to the left of a given node.  If left node exists, it is pushed down to left of inserted node.  
**2-binary_tree_insert_right.c**: Function that adds a node to the right of a given node. If right node exists, it is pushed down to right of inserted node.  
**3-binary_tree_delete.c**: Function that deletes a binary tree starting at the given node.  
**4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c**: Function that returns whether node is a leaf. 1 if leaf, 0 otherwise.  
**5-binary_tree_is_root.c**: Function that returns whether given node is root. 1 if root, 0 otherwise.  
**6-binary_tree_preorder.c**: Function that prints out the contents of a binary tree using pre-order traversal.  
**7-binary_tree_inorder.c**: Function that prints out the contents of a binary tree using in-order traversal.  
**8-binary_tree_postorder**: Function that prints out the contents of a binary tree using post-order traversal.  
**9-binary_tree_height**: Function that returns the height of a binary tree from a given node.  
**10-binary_tree_depth**: Function that returns the depth of a node in a binary tree.   
**11-binary_tree_size**: Function that returns the number of nodes in a binary tree.  
**12-binary_tree_leaves**: Function that returns the number of leaf nodes in a binary tree starting at a given node.  
**13-binary_tree_nodes**: Function that returns the count of nodes with at least 1 child.  
**14-binary_tree_balance.c**: Function that returns the balance factor of a binary tree starting at a given node.  
**15-binary_tree_is_full.c**: Returns whether a binary tree is full. 1 if full, 0 otherwise.  
**16-binary_tree_is_perfect**: Returns whether a binary tree is perfect. 1 if perfect, 0 otherwise.  
**17-binary_tree_sibling.c**: Returns the sibling node of a given node in a tree. NULL if no sibling.  
**18-binary_tree_uncle.c**: Returns the sibling of the parent of a given node. NULL if no uncle.  
**100-binary_tree_ancestor.c**: Returns the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a tree. NULL if no common ancestor found.  
**101-binary_tree_levelorder.c**: Print out a binary tree in level-order traversal.
